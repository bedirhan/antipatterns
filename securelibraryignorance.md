# Secure Library Ignorance

A decent application is deployed with lots of 3rd party plugins and/or libraries both server-side and client-side. Apart from the security of the code written exclusively for the application, the security problems of these libraries are usually missed out.

Worse yet, the security problems of these 3rd party libraries are mostly published and open to everyone's reading.
