# Software Security Anti-Patterns
An anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive [1]. In short anti-patterns are commonly reinvented but bad solutions to problems.

There are numerous anti-patterns in software security;

- [Pardon the malintent](pardonthemalintent.md)
- [Copy-Paste insecure code] (copypasteinsecurecode.md)
- Incomplete mediation
- Blacklisting
- Loosening blacklists
- Widening whitelists
- Insufficient www knowledge
- Secure library ignorance
- Mixing code and data
- Confirmation bias
