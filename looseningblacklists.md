# Loosening Blacklists

There are a handful of input validation strategies that a developer can utilize; blacklisting, normalization, whitelisting, encoding and such. However, the first strategy usually that comes to mind against a security problem is unfortunately the blacklisting.

For simple applications blacklists may prevail against attacks, however, as the application gets heavier in complexity the filters get complicated. But still a huge and well-thought filter may seem to be successfull. 

But sooner or later customers begin to experience problems when entering normal inputs and the Business gets oppressive. The result would be to remove some of the characters or words from the blacklist used without the awareness of the security teams if they exist. That leads to insecure days.
